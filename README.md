# better-unity-scene-manager
A more intuitive alternative to Unity's built-in scene manager

Create an instance of the BuildIndexMatrix Scriptable Object by right-clicking and choosing Create->Build-index Matrix

This will automatically populate the object with correct data regarding the build-indexes of your scenes.
To change scenes, simply pass the name of the desired scene into the BetterSceneManager object.
